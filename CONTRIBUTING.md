- Try to avoid merge conflicts if possible.
- Try to avoid a pull request with too many changes if possible.
  - A large pull request not only stretches the review time, but also makes it much harder to spot issues.
  - It is better to split the pull request to multiple smaller ones.
- If your pull request is not ready but want to save it first, you can submit it by mark as draft, and no need to add any identifications to the title (e.g.: `[WIP] XXXXXXXX`).
